1. If the class does not have any attributes and we dont need to have multiple instances then create just the functions in a file 
2. File opening, closing with Context manager with open('file','r') as f:
3. Use type annotations
4.  Istread of check if file exists, try to open it and throw a FileNotFoundError (try: except FileNotFoundError:)
5. Use @dataclass to model related data
   Use filed() to creade attributes of @dataclass with default values(from dataclass import dataclass, field)
6. Centralize constants on top of python file (convert to constans of config variables parameters of the logic)
7. List of objects can converted to Iterator[Object]
